# VishkARma

**Project Title**: VishkARma

**Description**:  
*VishkARma* is an Augmented Reality (AR) assistance tool designed for visualizing 3D-generated objects in real-world environments. This application helps VFX professionals streamline their workflow by allowing users to capture 2D images, convert them into 3D models using Blender, and place these models onto detected surfaces in AR via Unity. 

**Key Features**:
- **AR Plane Detection**: Identify and use real-world surfaces for placing 3D models.
- **2D to 3D Model Conversion**: Transform 2D images into 3D models through Blender integration.
- **Customizable Scrollable Menu**: Easily browse and select 3D objects from a dynamic scrollable menu.
- **Multi-Object Placement**: Position multiple 3D models at various locations on detected planes.
- **VFX Pre-Visualization**: Preview complex VFX setups in AR, enhancing professional workflows.

**Technologies Used**:
- **Unity**: Main platform for AR functionalities and UI development.
- **Blender**: Tool for converting 2D images to 3D models.
- **AR Foundation**: Framework for building cross-platform AR experiences.

**Installation**:
1. Clone or download the project repository.
2. Open the project in **Unity** (version 2020.3 or later recommended).
3. Install **Blender** for model conversion if not already available.
4. Set up **AR Foundation** to ensure compatibility with ARKit/ARCore.
5. Build and deploy the project to a mobile device to use AR features.

**Usage**:
1. **Capture**: Take a 2D image of the object you wish to convert into a 3D model.
2. **Convert**: The app interfaces with Blender to convert the image into a 3D model.
3. **Visualize in AR**: Place the 3D model on detected surfaces in AR using Unity.
4. **Customize**: Use the scrollable menu to select and position multiple objects in the AR environment.

**Future Improvements**:
- Integration of real-time lighting effects for more realistic object placement.
- Enhanced user interface for improved model browsing and selection.
- Support for additional 3D file formats and real-time model editing in AR.
